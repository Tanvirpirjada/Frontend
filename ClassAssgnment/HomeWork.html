  <li><b>1941</b>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br>to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
  <li><b>1942</b>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
  <li><b>1944</b>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
  <li><b>1945</b>-Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br>yields</li>
  <li><b>1953</b>- crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>

Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous <br>because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br>time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
  <li><b>2009</b>-dies at the age of 95</li>

    <h3>Apprentice at Geekster</h3>
    <p>
        During my Full Stack Web Development Training at Geekster, I dove headfirst into a 
        comprehensive curriculum covering a range of programming languages and tools, including Java, DSA, 
        Spring Boot, OOPS, SQL, and AWS-EC2. I solved over 100 problems on LeetCode and participated in coding 
        competitions on HackerRank to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. I also worked on 
        several projects, including a full stack web application built with Java and Spring Boot. Overall, this training was a game-changing experience 
        that gave me a solid foundation in software development and exposed me to a wide range of tools and technologies.
